# Neural Network Approach to Partial Differential Equations

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). PINNs leverage deep learning while embedding physical laws directly into the loss function of the neural network. This approach enables efficient and accurate solutions for forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear PDEs. The methodology has applications in fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, and beyond.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Neural Network-based Framework**: Build a PINN model capable of solving PDEs.
2. **Solve PDEs for Benchmark Problems**: Apply the method to test cases, such as the Burgers' equation, Schrödinger equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.
3. **Analyze Performance**: Compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PINN framework against classical numerical methods.
4. **Provide Open-Source Code**: Share the implementation on GitHub for the community to use and build upon.

## Methodology
1. **Problem Setup**
   - Define the target PDE of the form:
     \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathcal{N}[u; \lambda] = 0, \]
     where \( u(t, x) \) is the solution, \( \mathcal{N}[\cdot; \lambda] \) is a nonlinear operator, and \( \lambda \) represents parameters.
   - For data-driven solutions, provide initial and boundary conditions.

2. **Neural Network Architecture**
   - Use feed-forward neural networks with hyperbolic tangent activation functions.
   - Employ automatic differentiation to compute derivatives of the network outputs with respect to inputs.

3. **Loss Function Design**
   - Combine data-based and physics-informed components:
     \[ \text{Loss} = \text{MSE}_{data} + \text{MSE}_{physics}, \]
     where \( \text{MSE}_{physics} \) enforces the PDE constraints at collocation points.

4. **Training Procedure**
   - Optimize network parameters using quasi-Newton (L-BFGS) and stochastic gradient descent methods.
   - Utilize datasets generated via numerical simulations as training data.

5. **Validation**
   - Validate solutions against exact or numerical results.
   - Perform sensitivity studies to assess the robustness to noise and hyperparameter choices.

## Implementation
The implementation involves the following components:
- **Data Preparation**: Generate or import datasets for PDE benchmarks.
- **Model Definition**: Implement the PINN framework using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **Training and Optimization**: Train the model with the designed loss function.
- **Visualization**: Plot the results for solution accuracy and PDE satisfaction.

## Results

- High accuracy in solving classical PDEs such as the Burgers' equation.

- Applicability to both forward and inverse problems.
